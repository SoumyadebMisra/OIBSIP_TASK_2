              <strong class="bio__text__str"> Alan Turing was an English mathematician, logician, and computer
              scientist who lived from 1912 to 1954.</strong>
            </p>
            <p> He is widely considered to
              be one of the fathers of computer science and artificial
              intelligence.</p>
            <p>
              Turing attended King's College, Cambridge, where he studied
              mathematics and developed his interest in computing. He later
              worked at the Government Code and Cypher School during World War
              II, where he played a crucial role in breaking the German Enigma
              code, which helped the Allies win the war.
            </p>
            <p>
              Turing continued his work in computer science and
              artificial intelligence. He developed the concept of a universal
              machine, which would become the theoretical basis for modern
              computing. He also proposed the Turing Test, a measure of a
              machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to,
              or indistinguishable from, that of a human.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
              Despite his groundbreaking work, Turing's life was marred by
              persecution for his homosexuality. He was convicted of
              homosexuality in 1952 and subjected to chemical castration. He
              died two years later, at the age of 41, from an apparent suicide
              by cyanide poisoning.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2009, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a public
              apology on behalf of the government for the way Turing was
              treated. In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous
              royal pardon for his conviction.

                    Alan Turing was a
                    brilliant mathematician and logician who helped lay the theoretical
                    foundations for modern computing, and his ideas and innovations
                    continue to shape the field today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Turing was also an important figure in the fight against fascism
                    during World War II, using his skills to help break the German
                    Enigma code and turn the tide of the war in favor of the Allies. His
                    work in codebreaking helped save countless lives, and his legacy in
                    this regard is still celebrated today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, Turing's tragic persecution for his homosexuality and
                    his subsequent death have made him a symbol of the struggle for
                    LGBTQ+ rights. His story serves as a reminder of the injustice and
                    discrimination that marginalized groups have faced throughout
                    history, and his courage and perseverance in the face of persecution
                    have made him an inspiration to many.
